            <h2>AANG</h2>
            <p>Aang is a 12-year-old airbending monk from the Southern Air Temple. As the Avatar, he is the only person in the world who is able to master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air.
               Although most Avatars are told of their unique capabilities and province when they turn 16, Aang was told earlier to begin his training. The elder airbender monks knew of an
               impending war started by the Fire Nation for colonization. Aang initially rejected his role as the Avatar, ran away from the air temple with his flying sky bison, Appa,
               and encountered a great storm. In order to save himself and Appa, Aang used waterbending to freeze them in a block of ice. The two were frozen for 100 years, resulting in the Fire Nation
               colonization of nearly the entire world to occur. In the first episode, <span class="emphasized">The Boy in the Iceberg</span>, Aang and Appa are rescued by Katara and Sokka. The series follows the journey
               of Aang and his friends across the globe, having fun adventures while also learning about the atrocities of war, all while trying to find bending masters to help him master the four elements,
               and ultimately save the world. </p>

            <h3>KATARA</h3>
            <p>Katara is a 14-year-old waterbender from the Southern Water Tribe. She has an older brother, Sokka, who she acts motherly towards, despite being younger than him. Their father, Hakoda, is the chief of the Southern Water Tribe and thus is away to fight
               in the war. She and Sokka lost their mother, Kya, at a young age, resulting in the two having to grow up quickly. Katara is the one to free Aang and Appa from the iceberg, albeit unintentionally, 
               via waterbending. From the moment she met Aang, Katara knew there was something special about him. Being a young waterbender herself, and the only waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe, Katara is still a novice. After finding out Aang is the Avatar, 
               Katara and Sokka decide to travel the world with him, all while Katara teaches him how to waterbend as she learns herself. She is known for her maternalism, courage, feminism, helping those in need, 
               and standing up for what she believes in. </p>

            <h4>SOKKA</h4>
            <p>Sokka is a 15-year-old non-bender from the Southern Water Tribe, and is Katara's brother. Known for his humor, he describes himself as, "the meat and sarcasm guy," and "just a guy with a boomerang." He finds solace in other non-benders, forming deep connections with several
               throughout the series. Sokka wishes to emulate his father; to become a fearless and courageous leader, and kick Fire Nation butt. He is known for his delegative leadership; being the one to (usually) come up with the team plan, schedule, strategy, and even fun catchphrases and nicknames. 
               Sokka is the kind of person who can be funny when he needs to be funny, and serious when he needs to be serious. </p>

            <h5>TOPH</h5>
            <p>Toph is a 12-year-old earthbender from the immense Earth Kingdom. She is the only child of the affluent Beifong family, and was born blind. Due to her blindness, her parents treat her like glass and won't let her practice earthbending techniques more advanced than what a young child learns.
               This sheltering causes Toph to rebel, and she joins an underground earthbending tournament, where she practices extremely advanced earthbending, and is the undefeated champion, alias "The Blind Bandit". Aang, Katara, and Sokka (Team Avatar) first meet Toph at one of the tournaments. Aang is the first person from Team Avatar to 
               introduce himself to Toph, and does so by joining her in the ring. Aang explains he needs an earthbending teacher, and Toph's parents completely reject this idea. However, Toph disobeys her parents and runs away with Team Avatar, letting them know that she will travel with them and teach Aang earthbending. </p>

            <h6>ZUKO</h6>
            <p>Zuko is a 16-year-old firebender, and crown prince of the Fire Nation. After enduring a duel with his abusive father, Ozai, Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation. The Avatar is the greatest threat against the Fire Nation, so Zuko was sent on a quest to capture the Avatar. Ozai told Zuko that capturing the Avatar was the only possible way 
               to restore his honor, and the only way he could return home. Zuko and his uncle, Iroh, traveled the globe for 3 years searching for Aang to no avail, until Katara and Sokka broke him out of the iceberg. Since then, Zuko travels the world following and fighting Team Avatar, and trying to capture Aang. Throughout the show, Zuko
               experiences a wealth of angst and suffering, struggling to know what is right and wrong. His struggle with morality and ethics is pivotal to his character, as he battles with what he knows to be the truth. </p>
